# Methodology Mapping 

This guide presents a modular structure for mapping and analyzing research methodologies. 

---

## 1. Methodological Identification

- **Author or Source**: Name of the researcher or institution.
- **Work Title**: Title of the publication or study.
- **Year**: Year of methodological application or publication.
- **Field of Study**: Disciplinary domain (e.g., sociology, computer science).
- **Methodological Label**: Formal name of the method (e.g., grounded theory, ethnography, regression analysis).

> _Purpose: Establish metadata for methodological traceability and classification._

---

## 2. Research Design Overview

- **Design Type**: Qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, theoretical, or computational.
- **Study Format**: Case study, experiment, survey, simulation, etc.
- **Temporal Scope**: Cross-sectional, longitudinal, historical, real-time.
- **Unit of Analysis**: Individuals, groups, texts, systems, etc.

> _Purpose: Clarify the structural blueprint of the research process._

---

## 3. Epistemological and Ontological Foundations

- **Epistemic Orientation**: Positivist, interpretivist, constructivist, critical, etc.
- **Ontological Assumptions**: Nature of reality assumed (e.g., objective, socially constructed).
- **Philosophical Influences**: Key thinkers or schools shaping the methodological stance.

> _Purpose: Situate the method within its philosophical and theoretical grounding._

---

## 4. Data Strategy

- **Data Sources**: Primary (e.g., interviews, observations) or secondary (e.g., archives, datasets).
- **Sampling Strategy**: Random, purposive, snowball, theoretical, etc.
- **Data Collection Techniques**: Surveys, fieldwork, scraping, instrumentation, etc.
- **Data Volume and Format**: Size, structure, and modality (textual, numeric, visual).

> _Purpose: Document how data is acquired and structured for analysis._

---

## 5. Analytical Procedures

- **Techniques Used**: Coding, statistical modeling, simulation, discourse analysis, etc.
- **Tools and Software**: NVivo, R, Python, SPSS, Atlas.ti, etc.
- **Validation Strategies**: Triangulation, peer review, replication, robustness checks.
- **Interpretive Frameworks**: Deductive, inductive, abductive reasoning.

> _Purpose: Detail the operational logic and technical execution of analysis._

---

## 6. Methodological Rationale

- **Justification**: Why this method was chosen over alternatives.
- **Alignment with Objectives**: How the method supports the research question.
- **Limitations Acknowledged**: Constraints, biases, or trade-offs.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Consent, privacy, data integrity, positionality.

> _Purpose: Assess the coherence and responsibility of methodological choices._

---

## 7. Comparative Methodological Positioning

- **Similar Methods**: Related approaches in the literature.
- **Contrasting Methods**: Alternatives with different assumptions or outcomes.
- **Interdisciplinary Adaptations**: Use of the method across fields.
- **Evolution Over Time**: Historical development or refinement of the method.

> _Purpose: Enable comparative analysis and methodological synthesis._

---

## 8. Application and Impact

- **Empirical Reach**: Fields or problems where the method is commonly applied.
- **Innovative Uses**: Novel or hybrid applications.
- **Policy or Practice Integration**: Influence on decision-making or implementation.
- **Scholarly Reception**: Citations, critiques, and methodological debates.

> _Purpose: Evaluate the method’s relevance, adaptability, and scholarly footprint._

---

## 9. Researcher’s Commentary

- **Strengths Observed**: What works well in practice.
- **Challenges Encountered**: Practical or conceptual difficulties.
- **Reflections on Use**: Lessons learned or insights gained.
- **Suggestions for Future Use**: Modifications, extensions, or new contexts.

> _Purpose: Encourage reflexivity and methodological refinement._

---

## 10. Referential Methodology Network

- **Key Methodologists**: Foundational figures or developers.
- **Canonical Works**: Seminal texts or studies using the method.
- **Complementary Approaches**: Methods that integrate well.
- **Critical Literature**: Debates and critiques surrounding the method.

> _Purpose: Build a networked understanding of the method’s intellectual ecosystem._
